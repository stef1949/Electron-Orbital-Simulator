# Electron Orbital Simulator

## Overview
In the simulation the "probability" of an electron being in a certain location is given by the square root of the wave function (∣ψ∣^2) for a specified orbital moment. The sim code runs a process called Monte Carlo simulation. By randomly sampling different points then checking the probability density at the given point, if the the probability is high then the point remain visualised. Samppled points with low probability are discarded

## Instructions
- Slider changes the number of sampled points
    - High Density: More points, fuller visualisation and mroe detailed representation of orbital's shape
    - Low Density: Fewer points, more sparse visualisation, faster but less detailed
